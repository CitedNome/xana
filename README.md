### Re-inventing the concept of Virtual Assistant
When we talk about virtual assistant we immediately think about polite and powerful Artificial Intelligence, ready to execute our requests and fulfill our requirements.
Xana, instead, was born to break this concepts and rules. She won't listen to you, unless you say something that she can mock you for or trigger one of her terrible cynical jokes.

We're dedicated to bringing you the best in artificial intelligence technology. Our team of engineers works tirelessly to make sure our AI assistant is always up and running, ready to ignore your commands and answer your questions with random insults.
